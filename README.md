# PHP SÄ°MPLE HTML DOM with news website
I found a library that can pull data from a site to my own site with php. I used it and pulled the yield from a news site. The data drawn from Milliyet is for testing purposes only. I do not have any profit motive. Although I have pasted their site for testing, I do not put any website links for the files I will send to the community, instead I fill it with // comment tags.

# Little CSS

I added a few css codes to make the design look nice. You can adjust it to your own taste.

# Outer Text

I printed all the html content very nicely when I used this print format.
