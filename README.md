# PHP Simple HTML DOM

I found a library that can pull data from a site to my own site with php. I used it and pulled the yield from a news site. The data drawn from Milliyet is for testing purposes only.  Although I have pasted their site for testing, I do not put any website links for the files I will send to the community, instead I fill it with  comment tags.
